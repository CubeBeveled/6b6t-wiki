## Founding information
* Founding date: 6/27/2024
* Founded by: 
  * [scarthebest1943](../Players/scar.md)

* Founding Story
>After scarthebest1943 found a lag exploit known as the /ignorelist region lag exploit, he gatekept it for a while until a few months later when a player known as Jajo341 also found the /ignorelist region lag exploit in which he quickly shared with vined_, which gave scarthebest1943 the idea to create a groupchat for everyone who knew/was going to know about the exploit which included vined_, jacob242, Jajo341, hokindo9000, and Sharedlines. c1yd3i & lil__perp were added later. A day or so after the groupchat was created Sharedlines mentioned the tp exploit that scarthebest1943 found, which made the group decide to remove Jajo341 from the groupchat as he was offline at the time and was the only one to not know about the tp exploit within the group.
